                    <h2>Our History</h2>
                    <p>Ethan Brantley, co-founder of Ethan &amp; Ann's, started making soap in 2016. He quickly fell in love with the hobby of soapmaking and branched out to other areas of skin care. He enjoys learning about chemistry and the molecular structure and benefits of soap, lotion, and other skin products. Three years later, after tinkering with his recipes and techniques, he and his mother Ann started up Ethan &amp; Ann's, a small business owned and operated out of the heart of the Colorado Rocky Mountains, to sell their skin-loving goods.</p>

                    <h2>Our Promise</h2>
                
                    <p>At Ethan &amp; Ann's, we firmly believe in quality over quantity. We want to make sure every oil, butter, or ingredient added to our products is quality, sustainable, and superior for us, for the environment, and for you. We work in small batches to ensure the highest quality in each bar, lotion, or balm. We strive to make our products as natural as possible, meaning we do not use SLS or parabens in our soaps and lotions: our products are natural and we think that's something to be proud of!</p>
                
                    <p>What does this mean for you? It means you can enjoy your lotion, soap, lip balm, or bath bomb, with the satisfaction that your using something natural, free from those pesky chemicals, and good for you, for your skin, and the environment. That's <em>our</em> promise!</p>
